# English Idiom Classifier
 
I completed this project so I could apply the data science and NLP skills I'd learnt to my own dataset.

## Demo:

## Tools and technologies used:
* Python3
  * BeautifulSoup
  * NumPy
  * pandas
  * NLTK
  * SpaCy
  * scikit-learn
  * keras

## Challenges:
* Preventing overfitting with the training dataset
  * Because of the wide variety of types of idiomatic expressions, it was difficult to prevent the LSTM model overfitting to particular patterns founding the training set, eg. Part-of-speech sequences such as noun-preposition-noun
